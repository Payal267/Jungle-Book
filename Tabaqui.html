   <h1>How Tabaqui Described in Jungle Book:</h1>
   <h2><p>Tabaqui "Dish-Licking Dog" golden jackal he feeds on scraps from either Shere Khan or the wolves of the Seeonee Pack. In some adaptations, he is a striped hyena. Tabaqui is a servant of Shere Khan as well as Shere Khan's spy and messenger.Tabaqui is just as sneaky and cunning as Shere Khan, but is not fierce like the tiger. He can also be pretty cowardly sometimes. And yet, the jackal is also shown to be lazy seen in "Monster of The Cold Lair", when he saw easier to take food from others instead of hunting for it.

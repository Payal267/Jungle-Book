   <h1>How Sherkhan Described in Jungle Book:</h1>
   <h2><p>The original Jungle Book stories
    Shere Khan is depicted by Kipling with being born with a crippled leg and was derisively nicknamed "Lungri" ("The Lame One") by his mother. Despite this condition, Shere Khan is prideful and regards himself as the "rightful" lord of the jungle.A powerful Bengal tiger, Shere Khan is considered suave and charming, yet is deeply feared as the most ferocious predator in the jungle. His reputation was such that he needed only to show himself to intimidate his victims. Khan is equally notorious for his animosity toward man, due to his fear of guns and fire.
